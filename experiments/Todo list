Hello, Welcome to hangman.
Please guess the word!

Each wrong guess takes our friend one step closer to his doom.

You have 9 wrong guesses left before he hangs!

Would you like to:
1) Guess a letter?
2) Guess the whole word?

if statement :
correct letter > print on dash
wrong letter > puts "Uh oh, try again"

Replace dashes with letters

- I want to represent my word as a hash of placeholders (dashes)
> how do I show dashes? = make an array of dashes
> if statement: if word is guessed, replace dash with letter
(same index, replace or map?)
